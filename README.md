# Rawan Yaghmour
My name is Rawan Yaghmour, I'm 21 years old, and I live in Amman in the Yasmeen suburb. I recently graduated from university with a degree in Software Engineering. I have a passion for programming and robotics.

In a recent project called "Peer Assistance and Leadership," I worked with a team of three. My friend and I were responsible for the backend using Asp.net, despite having no prior experience. We faced challenges, but we never gave up and ended up securing the second position in the College of Information Technology.

While my experience with Asp.net is limited, having worked on different project aspects, including databases and documentation, I aim to further develop my skills in this field for more opportunities.

I chose this course for two reasons. First, it was the only available option, but even if there were others, I would have picked it because I see it as a challenging opportunity that can make mastering other domains easier. Moreover, I strongly believe that this course is the beginning of achieving my aspirations.

I aspire to achieve various goals, such as becoming a successful individual with a remarkable success story filled with effort, perseverance, and the refusal to give up.
