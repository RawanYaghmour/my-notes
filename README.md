# Rawan Yaghmour
My name is Rawan Yaghmour, I'm 21 years old, and I live in Amman in the Yasmeen suburb. I recently graduated from university with a degree in Software Engineering. I have a passion for programming and robotics.

In a recent project called "Peer Assistance and Leadership," I worked with a team of three. My friend and I were responsible for the backend using Asp.net, despite having no prior experience. We faced challenges, but we never gave up and ended up securing the second position in the College of Information Technology.

While my experience with Asp.net is limited, having worked on different project aspects, including databases and documentation, I aim to further develop my skills in this field for more opportunities.

I chose this course for two reasons. First, it was the only available option, but even if there were others, I would have picked it because I see it as a challenging opportunity that can make mastering other domains easier. Moreover, I strongly believe that this course is the beginning of achieving my aspirations.

I aspire to achieve various goals, such as becoming a successful individual with a remarkable success story filled with effort, perseverance, and the refusal to give up.


From today's lecture, I learned about several fundamental concepts in software development and version control:

1. **Difference between GUI and CLI (Command Line Interface)**:
   - GUI (Graphical User Interface) provides a visual way for users to interact with software through graphical elements like windows, icons, and buttons.
   - CLI (Command Line Interface) allows users to interact with software through text-based commands entered into a terminal or command prompt.

2. **Basic terminal commands**:
   - Terminal commands are text-based instructions used to perform various tasks in a command-line environment. Examples include `cd` (change directory), `ls` (list directory contents), `mkdir` (make directory), `rm` (remove), `cp` (copy), and `mv` (move).

3. **Version Control System (VCS)**:
   - VCS is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing multiple contributors to collaborate on a project efficiently. It tracks modifications, facilitates version comparison, and enables the reverting of changes if needed.

4. **Git**:
   - Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle projects of any size with speed and efficiency. It allows developers to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage code versions effectively.

5. **Basic Git commands**:
   - Common Git commands include `git init` (initialize a new Git repository), `git add` (stage changes for commit), `git commit` (record changes to the repository), `git push` (send changes to a remote repository), `git pull` (fetch and integrate changes from a remote repository), and `git clone` (create a copy of a repository).

6. **GitHub**:
   - GitHub is a web-based platform built around Git that provides hosting for software development projects. It offers features like collaborative tools, issue tracking, pull requests, and project management.

7. **Difference between Git and GitHub**:
   - Git is a version control system, while GitHub is a hosting platform for Git repositories. Git is the technology used for version control, whereas GitHub is a service that hosts Git repositories and provides additional collaboration features.

8. **Markdown language**:
   - Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. It allows users to format text without using complicated HTML tags. Markdown is commonly used for formatting README files, documentation, and online content.

9. **Cloning a repository using SSH**:
   - Cloning a repository using SSH involves using the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol to securely authenticate and transfer data between a local machine and a remote repository. This process creates a local copy of the repository on the user's machine, allowing them to work on the project locally.

Overall, today's lecture provided a comprehensive introduction to essential concepts and tools in software development and version control, laying the foundation for effective collaboration and project management.
